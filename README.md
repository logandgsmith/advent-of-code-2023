# Advent of Code 2023

Collection of solutions and attempts for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)! This year I'm not going to tie myself specifically to Rust, but I will try to do at least some of the challenges in it. 


## Day 1 -- Rust
A short little warm up... and another appearance of [my favorite snippet from Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/file/read_lines.html).

## Day 2 -- Python
Cubes! Got caught up with this one. I should have focused on what the question was looking for instead of spending time trying to figure out how the data should look for something like this.

## Day 3 -- Javascript
Again -- I wasted a lot of time with this one trying to think of a slick way to analyze the data by iterating over it only once. (I did not, but I'd like to see someone do it).

## Day 4 -- Go
Today was the first time I've used Go. Honestly, I didn't see much of the appeal that I've heard about. It wasn't a hard syntax or anything, it just gave me a lot of flashbacks of Java! I might try Go again on a harder challenge.
